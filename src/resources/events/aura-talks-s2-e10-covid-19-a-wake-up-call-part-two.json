Building on top of what was already expressed, their conversation continues on to highlight how crucial it is for community members to revert back to the early days where there was more simplicity and less materialistic desires. Is the outbreak of COVID-19 the big wake-up call that the community needed to raise social consciousness? Is it possible at this stage to recreate the “prosperity basket” scheme that existed during the pioneering days? If you were ever curious about how Auroville’s economy was structured a few decades ago, this is the perfect episode for you! Please tune in to hear some personal thoughts on how much Auroville can grow from addressing the challenges of these unsettling times. Happy Viewing~ Ciao for now~!"
