      "content": "On today’s episode, Dan Be is joined by Pashi Kapur, a founding member of the Exploring Prosperity Team in Auroville. In this conversation, Pashi shares his honest views on how Auroville has slowly deviated from its original vision during the nearly five decades that he has lived in Auroville. He asserts that reshaping Auroville’s economy should be the utmost priority to realign to the vision of the Mother. A pioneer by nature, Pashi also shares some thoughts on the benefits of decentralising certain processes in Auroville. Have ever wondered how the pioneers lived during the 70’s and 80’s? Have you ever wanted to learn about Auroville’s vision from a person who had personal contact with the founder of the community? If so, this is the perfect episode for you to tune in! Happy Viewing~! As we always like to say on Aura Talks, ciao for now!"
