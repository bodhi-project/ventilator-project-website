Building on top of what was already expressed, their conversation continues on to explore the different stages of Auroville’s economic development. Was the introduction of individual Financial Service accounts a wrong turn that led to a deviation from the vision of prosperity as envisioned by the Mother? If you were ever curious about what type of concrete steps could be taken to revive Auroville’s economy, this is the perfect episode for you! Happy Viewing~ Ciao for now~!"
