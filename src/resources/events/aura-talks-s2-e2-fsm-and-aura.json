Together, they provide some necessary background on the Aura project: how the project began and how it has developed over time.

In addition to outlining the subtle differences between FSM and Aura, Jonas and Dan Be break down the components of a “Social Sharing Network” and discuss what determines the successful adoption of a new technological product or service.
