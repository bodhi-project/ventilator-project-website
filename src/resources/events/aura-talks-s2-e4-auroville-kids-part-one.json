Together, they candidly share with each other how life outside of Auroville differs to community life and how their relationship to the community has changed over time. If you would like to hear what their personal takes are on the Aura Platform, and what potential they see for the Aura to have a positive impact on the community, this is the perfect episode for you! What is more fruitful than childhood friends walking down memory lane as adults and reflecting together? Happy Viewing~! Please stay tuned for Part 2 of the Auroville Kids episode! Ciao for now~!"
