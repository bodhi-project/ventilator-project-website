Building on top of what was already expressed, their conversation continues on to explore the different ways in which they have changed ever since leaving the community. Do they have more materialistic desires ever since living abroad? Do they believe that it is possible to live a simple and basic life in a society filled with social expectations? Speaking of societal expectations, do community members in Auroville face less pressure to look and present oneself in a certain way? If you would like to know how the Aura platform could help community members live a simple life that is free of mindless desires, this is the episode for you! Happy Viewing~ Ciao for now~!"
