After briefly touching on the role of AVI (Auroville International), Julian and B share their thoughts on the positive impact that alternative currencies can have on strengthening local economies. What barriers does Aura as a virtual and complementary currency have to overcome in order to achieve widespread adoption in the community? Putting currency aside for a moment, have you ever wondered how Auroville as a community can strike the balance between embracing others whilst keeping the collective atmosphere and culture intact? If you have ever found yourself dealing with such a complex question, this is the perfect episode for you! Please tune in today to find out more about the global vision of Aura and how AVI could potentially facilitate the expansion of the Aura network! Happy Viewing~! Ciao for now!"
