      "content": "On today’s episode, Dan Be is joined by Jasmin, Mir and Eden who are Auroville youth that grew up in the community and have been a part of Auroville’s education system all their lives. After highlighting the beauties of Auroville’s diverse and intimate education, they go on to address the lack of youth engagement in the community. Do Auroville youth feel pressure from the older and ‘pioneer’ generation to give back to the community in a specific way? Moreover, do Auroville youth ever worry about whether they will be able to achieve financial independence without needing to go abroad and serve as seasonal workers? If you have ever been curious as to what type of thoughts Auroville youth have on relevant community topics and what suggestions they have to promote the local economy, this is the perfect episode for you! Please tune in today to hear more from younger members of the community! Happy Viewing~! As we always like to say on Aura Talks—ciao for now! Part II of this episode will be released next week! Stay tuned :)"
