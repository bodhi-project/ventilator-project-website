Building on top of what was already expressed, their conversation continues on to explore how digitalisation could lead to higher efficiency of workflows in Auroville. The conversation goes on to address whether they believe that digital solutions may lead to alienation and distancing in the physical realm, and what type of awareness is needed to ensure that people still feel connected. If you would like to hear what type of potential young members of the community see in the Aura platform, this is the perfect episode for you! Happy Viewing~ Ciao for now~!"
