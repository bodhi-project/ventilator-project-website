      "content": "Universal/Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) is a novel concept that is being explored around the world as an effective replacement for the conventional welfare system. The main idea behind UBI is to empower every individual in society by giving them a direct means to cover certain needs and transcend past the limits of being on survival mode. In developing nations, pilot UBI projects have been conducted to alleviate poverty amongst the most vulnerable groups, whereas more affluent nations have used UBI as a means to address the issues caused by displacement of jobs due to automation. Currently, the discussion regarding UBI in developed parts of the world is centered around the reduction of “bullshit jobs”: will individuals feel encouraged to meaningfully contribute to society when they do not face pressure to engage in any type of employment to cover their fundamental needs? The central issue of UBI is how it could be funded over the long-term: how can money, cash or resources be pooled to provide equal dividends to all? Recent research has explored new ways of taxation which would not only be dependent on one’s income, but also determined by one’s occupation of land, and level of carbon footprint. In the traditional mode of UBI, funding is primarily done through various modes of taxation and a promotion of the commercial sector."

      "content": "A completely new approach to funding UBI could be the focus on existing resources, and more specifically, the identification and in turn circulation of resources within a community that are most under-utilized. The philosophy of Circular Basic Income, in contrast to the traditional mode of Basic Income, assumes the existence of abundance—that within any given community, certain needs of the people can be met with existing resources without having to generate more income, or provide additional (financial) means to consume (new) goods and services. The creation of a virtual platform on which all under-utilized goods and services can be placed could create easy and equal access to all users who consciously choose to join the circular network. The essence of Basic Income could then be transferred onto such a virtual platform through an unconditional endowment of a virtual currency to all users who can use these credits to access the (under-utilized) goods and services and foster exchange."
